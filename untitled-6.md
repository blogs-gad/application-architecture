# 6 Key Benefits of Microservices Architecture

One challenge for developers beginning a new project is choosing between monolithic and microservice architecture.  According to [Camunda research](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/09/20/1573625/0/en/New-Research-Shows-63-Percent-of-Enterprises-Are-Adopting-Microservices-Architectures-Yet-50-Percent-Are-Unaware-of-the-Impact-on-Revenue-Generating-Business-Processes.html), 63% of enterprise level companies have taken steps to apply microservice architecture.

Let’s take a closer look at the benefits and implementation of microservice architecture and why enterprise level companies, like Amazon, Netflix, and Uber, are choosing this architecture over traditional monolithic architecture?

## **Why Microservices?**

[Microservices architecture](https://stackify.com/what-are-microservices/) allows developers to create separate components of an application through building an application from a combination of small services. Each of these services is built individually and deployed separately, so they run their own processes and communicate with the help of lightweight APIs. 

Microservices make it easier to test, understand, and maintain application builds with the combination of independent components.  It is an excellent solution for building large-scale products and improving workflows and productivity. Distributed teams often find it easier to create applications with microservice architecture.

## **6 Benefits of Microservices Architecture**

Let’s take a detailed look at the benefits of microservice architecture.  

**Isolation**

Microservices are profitable due to their isolation and resilience.  If one of the components fail, developers have the option to use another service and the application will continue to run independently. This way, engineers can build and deploy services without the need to change the whole app.

**Scalability**

With the architecture of microservices based on small components, it’s easier for development teams to scale up or down following the requirements of a specific element. Isolation allows apps to run correctly when massive changes are happening. Microservices prove to be the perfect approach for companies working with various platforms and devices. 

**Productivity** 

Part of functionality associated with microservice architecture is the ability to easily understand when compared to an entire monolithic app. If you plan to expand your development team, microservices are a better pick. 

**Flexibility** 

The microservice approach lets developers choose the right tools for the right task. They can build each server utilizing a language or framework they need without affecting the [communication between microservices.](https://stackify.com/communication-microservices-avoid-common-problems/) 

**Faster project development**

Microservices work independently, so you don’t have to change the codebase in order to modify the features. You can change one component, test, and then deploy it individually. In turn, you will deliver the app faster. 

**Evolutionary**

Microservice architecture is a perfect choice for developers unable to predict the kinds of devices the app is going to run on. Developers can provide fast and controlled upgrades through not slowing down or stopping the apps. 

While microservices offer the opportunity for better productivity and tool selection, cons include teams using different coding languages, frameworks, libraries.  This can paralyze the team if they’re not ready for such independence. But if you’re working on a large-scale complex app, microservice architecture is the perfect choice. 

## **Microservices Architecture: Use Cases**

Let’s find out what companies are using microservice architecture and their use case

**Netflix** 

Netflix is one of the best examples of implementing microservice architecture. Back in 2009, Netflix moved from a monolithic architecture to microservices due to increasing demand for its services. But as no microservices existed back then, Netflix engineers created an open-source technology that offered the best Internet television network. By moving to microservices, the company’s developers were able to deploy thousands of code sections every day to support its [193 million](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/17/media/netflix-earnings-q4/index.html) subscribers and 10 billion hours of movies and TV series. 

**Uber**

Similar to other startups, Uber began with a monolithic architecture. It was simpler for the company’s founders when they provided clients only with the UberBLACK service. But, as the startup rapidly grew, developers decided switched to  microservices to use several languages and frameworks. Now, Uber has 1,300+ microservices focusing on improving app’s scalability. 

**Spotify**

With over 75m active users, Spotify’s founders decided to build a system with independently scalable components to make synchronization easier. For Spotify, the main benefit of microservices is the ability to prevent massive failures. Even if multiple services fail simultaneously, users won’t be affected. 

## **How to Implement Microservices Architecture?**

Inspired by Uber and Spotify’s success and want to start implementing the architecture? Here are a few tips for you. 

**Mind the business objectives**

The first step is understanding whether your business needs this technology. Let’s imagine you already have a working server. With  microservice implementation, you have a hundred services that need to be managed and many parts automated. Microservices work best for large enterprises that run tons of processes every day. But if you’ve only launched your startup, it’s better to choose the traditional approach. 

**Make sure everyone understands the task**

Before coding, all members of your team need to have enough knowledge and required skills such as data modeling, asynchronous programming, and API development. 

**Choose the programming language**

Microservices allow developers to utilize different coding languages and frameworks. Take time to discuss mobile or [web development technology stack](https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/web-development-stacks) of your product beforehand. 

**Consider data storing**

The database is a crucial part of every application. As you move from traditional architecture, develop  a strategy to split the database into a few tiny DBs. 

**Use Agile methodology**

The migration to microservices requires small teams that work with [Agile methodology](https://stackify.com/agile-methodology/). If there’s one large team of developers, reorganize them into several teams that work independently.

Before integrating this technology, you need to get your company and development team ready and take into account all the possible pitfalls. The success of the transition largely depends on the developers and the right strategies.

**Monitor your Microservices**

Microservices allow development teams to avoid many hidden pitfalls common in monolithic architecture.  Application performance management tools, such as Retrace, are essential to help monitor your microservice architecture.  Retrace is a code-level APM solution to manage and monitor the performance of your application throughout the development lifecycle with application metrics, error log integration, and server health metrics.
