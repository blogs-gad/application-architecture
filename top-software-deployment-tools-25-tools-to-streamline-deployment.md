# Top Software Deployment Tools: 25 Tools to Streamline Deployment

Software deployment tools make the process of distributing software and updates as easy as possible. Often, these tasks are automatic or scheduled to enable software developers to focus on what they do best – writing code. And the best tools work with a variety of platforms and types of infrastructures, making it easy to streamline your workflow in your preferred environment.

Software deployment tools also allow developers to collaborate on their projects, track progress, and manage changes. [Continuous integration and continuous deployment](https://stackify.com/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment-vs-continuous-integration/) may be utilized to deploy software as changes are made, providing seamless updates for end users.

To make deployment less complicated, Stackify now offers [Deployment Tracking](https://stackify.com/deployment-tracking/) inside of [Retrace](https://stackify.com/retrace/).  Deployment Tracking is extremely valuable so you can see when deployments happened and how they affected your application’s performance.  There will be visual indicators on your timelines when these events took place and you can easily use them to drill down into metrics that will give you an exact idea of what is happening in your application.

Choosing the best software deployment tool is tricky because what works best for one development team may not meet another team’s needs. **We’ve rounded up 25 of the best software deployment tools that can help many dev teams streamline their workflow and optimize efficiency to deliver better software, faster**.
